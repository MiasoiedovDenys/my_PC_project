                    As an experienced professional in the agribusiness industry
                    for over 15 years, I have recently made the decision to
                    pivot my career toward the field of front-end development.
                    In 2021, I discovered an interest in coding, initially as a
                    hobby, but later completed courses to improve my skills and
                    gain a new professional specialization. I am committed to
                    delivering results that are not only innovative but also
                    sustainable, with a focus on building long-term
                    relationships with clients and stakeholders. My goal is to
                    combine my expertise in sales with my proficiency in
                    front-end development to make valuable contributions to
                    collaborative projects.

                  a bit of Bootstrap. I hope Marco will like his business card
                  website, and if not, I can make adjustments according to his
